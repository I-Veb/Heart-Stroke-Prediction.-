# Heart-Stroke-Prediction.-
In this project I have used several Supervised Machine Learning models (As this is a classification Problem) such as Logestic Regression, Support Vector Machine(SVM), Decision Tree Classifier and K-Nearest Neighbors to train the data model using the information given in the data and predict the Heart Stroke.
