# Heart-Stroke-Prediction.-
In this project I have used several Supervised Machine Learning models (As this is a classification Problem) such as Logestic Regression, Support Vector Machine(SVM), Decision Tree Classifier and K-Nearest Neighbors to train the data model using the information given in the data and predict the Heart Stroke.


Model Accuracy:
The model accuracies of Logistic Regression, SVM, and KNN are quite similar, at around 93.8%. This means that all three models are
able to predict the risk of heart stroke with a high degree of accuracy. However, the Decision Tree Classifier has a slightly lower accuracy
of 89.8%. This means that it is more likely to make incorrect predictions than the other three models.
Relationship Between Risk Factors and Stroke:
The graphs of age vs. hypertension and heart disease vs. stroke show that there is a positive correlation between these risk factors and
stroke. This means that the higher your age, hypertension, and heart disease risk, the more likely you are to have a stroke.
However, the graph of heart disease and hypertension vs. stroke shows a peculiar trend. People with lower chances of hypertension and
heart disease have increased chances of stroke. This could be due to a number of factors, such as other underlying medical conditions or
lifestyle choices. More research is needed to understand this relationship better.
Other Risk Factors for Stroke:
The text states that other features such as marital status, residence type, and work type are also showing an effect on the chances of
stroke. This is important to note, as it means that there are other factors in addition to age, hypertension, and heart disease that can
increase your risk of stroke.

For example, people who are single or divorced may be at higher risk of stroke than married people. This could be due to a number of
factors, such as social isolation, stress, or unhealthy lifestyle choices.
Similarly, people who live in rural areas or who have high-stress jobs may also be at higher risk of stroke. This is because rural areas
may have less access to healthcare, and high-stress jobs can increase the risk of heart disease and other cardiovascular problems.Model Accuracy: The model accuracies of Logistic Regression, SVM, and KNN are quite similar, at around 93.8%.
